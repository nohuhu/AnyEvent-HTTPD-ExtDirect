3.02  Fri Oct 24 21:29:45 PDT 2014
    - Fixed a charset issue that caused grief to IE8 users
    - Improved test suite robustness

3.01  Mon Jun 16 20:05:48 PDT 2014
    - Added HTTP::Request to the dependency list. I assumed that it
      was required by AnyEvent::HTTPD but judging by the failure
      reports from CPAN testers it is not so.
    - Assorted tiny doc and misc touch-ups.

3.00  Thu Jun 12 19:41:35 PDT 2014
    - Initial version released. Version set to 3.00 to reflect that
      this gateway requires RPC::ExtDirect 3.0+, and for consistency
      with other gateways
