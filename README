AnyEvent::HTTPD::ExtDirect
==========================

    This module provides an RPC::ExtDirect gateway implementation for
    AnyEvent::HTTPD, a simple lightweight event based web server. Unlike
    other gateways like Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect or CGI::ExtDirect, this
    module is in fact more of an application server than just a plugin. You
    can think of it as Plack framework and Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect
    combined into one package.

    That said, the asynchronous event based nature of AnyEvent::HTTPD allows
    using it both as a standalone application server, and as a part of a
    larger program that may do other things besides serving Ext.Direct or
    plain HTTP requests. See "Non-blocking server" below.

    If you are not familiar with Ext.Direct, more information can be found
    in RPC::ExtDirect::Intro.
