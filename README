AnyEvent::HTTPD::ExtDirect
==========================

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an RPC::ExtDirect gateway implementation for
    AnyEvent::HTTPD, a simple lightweight event based web server. Unlike
    other gateways like Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect or CGI::ExtDirect, this
    module is in fact more of an application server than just a plugin. You
    can think of it as Plack framework and Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect
    combined into one package.

    That said, the asynchronous event based nature of AnyEvent::HTTPD allows
    using it both as standalone application server, and as a part of a
    larger program that may do other things besides serving Ext.Direct or
    plain HTTP requests. See "Non-blocking server" below.

    If you are not familiar with Ext.Direct, more information can be found
    in RPC::ExtDirect::Intro.

INSTALLATION

    To install this module type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test
        make install

EXAMPLES

    See included Ext JS examples for ideas on what Ext.Direct is and how to
    use it in an event based application server. The examples are not
    installed along with the AnyEvent::HTTPD::ExtDirect module, and are only
    available in the `examples/' directory of the CPAN distribution.

    To run examples type the following in the AnyEvent::HTTPD::ExtDirect
    tarball directory:

        cd examples
        perl server
